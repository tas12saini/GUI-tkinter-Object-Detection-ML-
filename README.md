# GUI-tkinter-Object-Detection-ML-
Made GUI with the help of tkinter and detected particular features with object detection using ML


Here the model has been made using pre-trained model - FCNN, Mobilnet and SSD.
First download the pre-trained models from: detection_model_zoo.md
Pictures can be directly fed into the system using GUI (made for this task)
Download the pre trained models and give their frozen_inference_graph.pb file name into the path
Write the detection threshold value between 0.0 - 1.0
And the press Detect button for detection
